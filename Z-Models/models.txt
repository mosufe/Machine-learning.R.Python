Methods of building a model

1-All-in
    In case of prior knowledge
    In case you are obligded to use these variables
    In case you are preparing for backwards elimination

2-Backward Elimination
    Step 1 - Select a significance level to stay in model
    Step 2 - Fit the full model with all possible predictors
    Step 3 - Consider the predictor with highest P-value. If P > significance level then select this predictor
    Step 4 - Remove the predictor
    Step 5 - Fit model without this variable and go back to step 3

3-Forward Selection
    Step 1 - Select a significance level to enter the model ex SL = 0.05
    Step 2 - Fit all simple regression models y ~ x. Select the lowest P-value
    Step 3 - Keep this bariable and fit all possible models with one extra predictor aadded to the ones you already have
    Step 4 - Consider the predictor with lowest P-value. If P < SL go to Step 3, otherwise finish keeping the previous model

4-Bidirectional Elimination
    Step 1 - Select a significance level to enter and stay in the model
